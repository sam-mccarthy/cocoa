# Cocoa

A fun, general-purpose Discord bot written in Rust.

## How do I run it?

There's a template `docker-compose.yaml` in the files - you can use that to set up Mongo, and then set up the bot.

## Why?

Many years ago, when I was but a child, one of my first major development projects was a general-purpose Discord bot -
it was written in C# using Discord.NET, and was a fantastic learning experience.

Recently, I've gained a renewed fondness for the idea, and decided to take another crack at it.

## Development

The bot is currently still very early in development, and as such, is relatively unstable. If you want to run the bot, 
do so at your own discretion.

Command implementation will come with time - I'm still not 100% sure on what I want to implement in the bot, and I'm not
sure how I want to implement it either - I'd like some sort of economy, but it'll take some time to figure out the
balance of it.

## Will this bot become available publicly? (i.e. with an officially hosted version)

Not yet - I'd like to finish ironing out the details and implementation and making sure there aren't any major issues.
